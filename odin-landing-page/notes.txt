Important Notes: 
1) Our suggestion: take it one section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer). 
2) Put all HTML code first then do the CSS. For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS.
